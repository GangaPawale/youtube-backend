# YouTube Backend

**Videotube** is a robust and scalable backend platform built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The project is designed to provide a comprehensive and secure infrastructure for building a video-sharing platform, similar to YouTube. The platform enables users to upload, manage, and share videos, as well as interact with each other through comments and likes.

Key Features:

**User Management**: The project features a robust user management system, allowing users to register, login, and manage their accounts. The system includes features such as password hashing, salting, and verification.

**Video Rest API**: The platform provides a RESTful API for creating, reading, updating, and deleting videos. The API includes features such as video uploading, video thumbnail generation, and video metadata management.

**Post (Image) Rest API**: In addition to videos, the platform also supports uploading and managing images (posts) through a separate REST API.

**MongoDB Aggregation**: The project utilizes MongoDB's powerful aggregation framework to perform complex queries and data processing tasks.

**Authentication**: The platform includes a robust authentication system, using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to secure user sessions and protect sensitive data.
